* source:trunk/src/Makefile.am (): Corrected it to use the LIBRARY_VERSION that is now defined in the configure.ac.

* source:trunk/src/stf.c (): Modified the license comment at the top to be listed under the GPL as it is now being dual licensed. I also corrected a bug with the naming of the stf_free_unit_test() function where it wasn't being defined as _stf_free_unit_test().

* source:trunk/configure.ac (): Added the LIBRARY_VERSION to the top and added it as a substitution for the Makefile.am files.

* source:trunk/headers/stf/stf.h (): Updated the license comment as it is now being dual licensed under the GPL and a proprietary license.

* source:trunk/headers/stf/stf.h (): Updated the license comment as it is now being dual licensed under the GPL and a proprietary license.

* source:trunk/examples/example_test.c (): Updated the license comment as it is now being dual licensed under the GPL and a proprietary license.

* source:trunk/src/Makefile.am (): Forgot to include the stf_export.h file in the header files that get installed. Hence, I corrected it.
